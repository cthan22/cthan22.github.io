    <h1>Caroline Han</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my website! I am a 3rd year Data Science and Health Science student at Northeastern University.
        I am from Needham, MA and my favorite color is purple. In my free time I like to bike, read, and play sudoku.
        Below is a picture of me; click to reveal my dog, Kiki.
